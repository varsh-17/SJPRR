# SJPRR
Shortest Job Prioritised Round Robin Algorithm
Abstract—
Round Robin algorithm (RR) is the widely used
scheduling algorithm in multitasking and real time environment
and cloud environments.In RR, much time is lost in the form
of switching time and hence an algorithm is proposed where a
dynamic and optimal time quantum is allocated for each process
in the ready queue based on its requirement. This paper describes
about the proposed algorithm,Shortest Job Prioritised Round
Robin Algorithm(SJPRR) which is written using base idea of
allocating dynamic time quantum to each process in every round
is expected to result in lesser average TAT and average WT.
